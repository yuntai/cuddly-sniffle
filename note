Use y our TOMB-LPs like a reserve stable coin. Split that bag and buy 2omb/3omb when they are closed to peg and make LPs to farm. Sell once 2-5x (depending on your risk appetite, but rmb as time goes by 2x will be harder and harder to come by). Sell profits and put the mback into tomb-lp to secure profits and acts as a reserve bag. Rinse, repeat. At least htat's for me.
